# Solar-System-3D
This project creates an interactive 3D solar system model using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to toggle between different views (2D/3D), zoom in/out, adjust speed, and change the size and distance of objects in the solar system. The solar systemâ€™s elements are dynamically styled based on screen size for responsiveness.
